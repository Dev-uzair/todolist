check if your basic security working fine after that
you have to implement this
1. add jwt dependencies -->  go to maven repository and search
                        "jjwt"
        -->    add jackson, impl , api dependency
        -->    maven reload

2. make JwtUtils method which we will use
        for
                                    generateToken
                                    validateToken
                                    isTokenExpired
                                    extractExpiration
                                    extractUsername
                                    extractClaims

3. after that make Jwt filter extend it with OncePerRequestFilter
    and override the method "doFIlterInternal"

4. modify security config
        -->.sessionManagement ( session->session.
                                   sessionCreationPolicy ( SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS ))
            default behaviour of security is statefull
       --> open login end point
       -->remove basic security and add jwt filter

       --> add authentication manager bean as we are going to use it in login process

5. add login endpoint in user controller
                we will make a request class of only email and password
                and one response class with token field
                so we can get the token in tokenresponse

    now we can access every end point with this generated token

run the app now.
